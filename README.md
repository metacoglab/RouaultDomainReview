# RouaultDomainReview

Code to support simulations reported in Rouault, McWilliams, Allen & Fleming (in prep) Human metacognition across domains: insights from individual differences and neuroimaging

This script reproduces the cross-domain correlation simulations reported in Figure 4 in the paper.
It requires the HMeta-d toolbox to be installed, which can be obtained <a href="https://github.com/metacoglab/HMeta-d">here</a>.
